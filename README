Directory Scanner is intended to replace r_search in searcher.c so that you can pipe the results 
of directoryscanner.c into searcher.c so a command will eventually be something like: 

scandirectory -d /usr/bin | searcher

But not sure how to make that happen yet.

Priority #1 is to make sure that the sliding window of the search works correctly currently it's brute forcing 
through the chunks of the files.
